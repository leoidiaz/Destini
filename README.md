### iOS App Design Pattern Challenge

A *choose your own adventure*  iOS game creation challenge as part of the iOS 13 Bootcamp taught by Angela Yu at the AppBrewery.

Swift topics reviewed in creating the app:

* Structs
* MVC 

I plan to eventually update the model to pull data from a server api or a JSON file to increase the duration of the game.
